# Kaprekar-Numbers

A Kaprekar Number for a given base is a non-negative integer, 
the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts—either 
or both of which may include leading zeroes—that add up to the original number. 
For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45^2 = 2025 and 20 + 25 = 45.
Another example would be 7777. 7777^2 = 60481729. 6048 + 1729 = 7777
This program would take in user input (integer) and return all Kaprekar Numbers between 1 and the user integer.
